# 1.0 Project Task Analysis

## 1.1 Project Name

The name of the project is "**University Comprehensive Community**". The system is suitable for teachers and students of various universities to find information online, publish articles and socialize, etc.

## 1.2 Main Purpose of the project

Provide a social question and answer website for schools, improve the learning efficiency of teachers and students, and improve the efficiency of communication. This type of website is a question-and-answer SNS website between an encyclopaedia and traditional Q & A. It is a public knowledge platform, and its value lies in rebuilding the relationship between people and information. Users ask questions and other users answer. The Q & A service expands broad keywords into clear questions and realizes the conversion of information to knowledge through constant revision by users.

## 1.3 Project Phase Analysis

### 1.3.1 Stage 1- Background research and Requirement Analyse 

1. By understanding the current situation and shortcomings of traditional Q & A websites, a preliminary analysis of the functional requirements of the system is made.
2. Make a questionnaire and distribute it on campus to learn about the habits of users and the status of self-study. There are 50 copies. Data were collected through questionnaires.
3. Randomly select a user for a face-to-face interview. Specify 4-5 main questions about self-study for interviews and invite users to answer. Record the results of the interview for later analysis.
4. Perform a step-by-step analysis of the collected data. First, analyse the data obtained from the questionnaire to determine user needs, and then analyse the interviews to obtain data. Finally, combined with the conclusions of the questionnaire survey and interviews, determine the exact user needs.

### 1.3.2 Stage 2- Program Development

1. First analyse user needs in combination with actual conditions, and discuss what technology is used to implement each requirement after the analysis is complete.
2. After completing most of the requirements, the code will be integrated and sent to the user, and the user will suggest modifications through the experience system.
3. Changes in requirements at any time during development

### 1.3.3 Stage 3- Test 

1. Unit tests are performed after not completing a module
2. Integration tests will be performed after the modules are brought together
3. Complete usability testing before submitting the system to users
4. After the system is submitted to the user, the user's internal test is first performed.
5. Perform all usability tests, stress tests, etc. in a real network environment

### 1.3.4 Stage 4- Deployed

After all development work and testing work are completed, the project will be deployed in a real network environment.

## 1.4 Background research

### 1.4.1 Second-hand Research

- **Second-hand research can help me identify the most promising markets by excluding unsatisfactory markets and lay the groundwork for further field investigations.**

  In international marketing, the role of second-hand data research is mainly manifested in the following two aspects:

  Second-hand research is an important source of information, for the next step in the development of research direction to lay the foundation. 

  Second-hand research can provide the necessary background information for field research, so that the goal of field research clearer, so as to save time and research costs, for field research to lay the foundation.

### 1.4.2 Field research

Field research is an effective research method. Before you start designing your system, you need to interview users and record the data you are investigating. Then you need to experience as much as possible of the full functionality of the existing question answering system. This is to facilitate the development of the system, avoid repetitive errors, and provide better services for school teachers and students.

### 1.4.3 Questionnaire

The questionnaire survey is a first-hand survey method. The questionnaire survey is a very effective way to obtain user needs. After subsequent data analysis, you can quickly and accurately obtain the needs of a large number of users. At this stage, it is necessary to avoid restrictions on user needs. Each questionnaire requires collection of 35 valid data. For the final analysis phase, I first need to summarize the data of each questionnaire and analyse them one by one to determine the initial functional requirements.

## 1.5 Analysis of research results

### 1.5.1 Analysis for Second-hand Research 

Investigate the status of existing Q & A communities and user feedback via the Internet.

After investigation found, the comprehensive Q & A community for universities is very scarce, and some companies have directly stopped the Q & A service (eg Google). Other types of Q & A communities only include some basic functions, and the functions that can be achieved are relatively single, and most of them only implement the functions of asking and answering questions. On the other hand, in terms of user search results, there are also limitations to what can be searched. Of course, the most important point is that this type of system is for global users, and the user range and user quality cannot be effectively controlled. In addition, the users of some systems are more targeted users and cannot be used by anyone (such as stackoverflow).

Through the above analysis, it can be shown that there is a vacancy in the Q & A community market for universities, which is feasible for developing such systems.

### 1.5.2 Analysis for Field research

After in-depth use of the Quorar system and understanding of all its functions, the following conclusions were reached.

- **Functional aspects**
  1. The features of the Quora system are relatively comprehensive, especially in terms of asking questions and answering questions. When users ask questions, the system standardizes the way users ask questions and sets tags for questions posted by users. The advantage of this is that users can accurately search for relevant solutions when querying problems.
  2. Quora has also established many discussion groups to allow users with the same preferences to communicate in the same discussion area. This approach will undoubtedly increase user usability and loyalty to the system.
  3. At the beginning of new user registration, the system supports third-party account logins, reducing the hassle of users creating multiple accounts. Users only need to have one account to log in to other platforms. Secondly, when a new user logs in for the first time, the system will ask the user to choose their preferences and the discussion group they want to join. These practices fully demonstrate the powerful functions of the system for user division and management.

- **User experience**

  Quora has a very clear display page, user self-management module and issue preview function. These indicate that Quora's human-computer interaction is well done, and it is worth quoting in project development.

- **Content aspect**
  1. Because Quora has many groups, the content displayed on the homepage is too cluttered, and it cannot quickly locate the problems that users are interested in or the problems to be solved.
  2. There is no specific retrieval method for the content of the questions answered by the user, which results in that the solution searched by the user is not 100% accurate, and the user needs to judge the solution by himself.

### 1.5.3 Analysis for Questionnaire

A total of 50 questionnaires were distributed and 50 were recovered, of which 47 were valid data.

**Q1:** The data obtained from the survey shows that the users participating in the survey are evenly distributed, so the survey data can be used as a reference

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q1.PNG?raw=true)

**Q2: **Through data analysis, when users encounter learning difficulties, the first solution they use is a search engine (40% of the total), followed by a Q & A system (36%). Ask classmates or teachers to find solutions that account for 10% and 12%, respectively. It can be seen that most users still prefer to search for solutions to problems through the Internet.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q2.PNG?raw=true)

**Q3:** When users search for answers through the Internet, only a few of them can find useful information (forty-eight percent), and only a small number of users can query the Internet for accurate solutions.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q3.PNG?raw=true)

**Q4:** When it comes to whether a professional mentor is required to solve a professional problem, the intentions of the users appear to be particularly consistent. Among them, 96% of the users want professional mentors to coach professional problems, and almost no one is unwilling.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q4.PNG?raw=true)

**Q5:** Among the user groups who ask teachers, most users can't get in touch with their mentors quickly and easily when they contact the teachers on weekends or breaks to answer questions. (60%) Even a small percentage of users with 16% cannot contact the mentor, and only 24% of users can contact the teacher at any time.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q5.PNG?raw=true)

**Q6:** The data collected through the sixth question shows that the questions that the user most wants to ask as a questioner are mainly professional-related questions and solutions corresponding to professional questions. Secondly, users are keen to ask questions about knowledge points, learning routes, and employment.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q6.PNG?raw=true)

**Q7:** Data on what caused the user to abandon the use of the question and answer system. Almost all users will abandon the system due to factors such as fees and the quality of the solution to the problem.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q7.PNG?raw=true)

**Q8:** Through data analysis, it is known that users most want to obtain useful information on the Q & A system, such as professional answers to professional questions, learning routes, recommended learning methods, and the latest related industry consulting.

![](https://github.com/Ma-Zhuang/Pic/blob/master/Q8.PNG?raw=true)

**Q9: For the user experience of the existing Q & A apps and Q & A platforms, what are you most satisfied with / are you least satisfied with?**

- **Positive**
  1. Has a large number of distributions, providing users with more than the relevant knowledge of the profession.
  2. Provide third-party account login to reduce the hassle of remembering account and passwords.
  3. Categorize questions for easy query
- **Negative**
  1. Search results have a lot of duplicates
  2. The content of the solution is called clutter, and you cannot find an accurate solution quickly.

**Q10:What features do you want in a complete Q  A system**

1. Blog
2. Online communication
3. Industry Information
4. Tutors participate in Q & A
5. Recommend articles or questions based on user interests
