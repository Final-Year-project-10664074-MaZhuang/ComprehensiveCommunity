# 1.0 Project Task Analysis

## 1.1 Project Name

The name of the project is "**University Comprehensive Community**". The system is suitable for teachers and students of various universities to find information online, publish articles and socialize, etc.

## 1.2 Main Purpose of the project

Provide a social question and answer website for schools, improve the learning efficiency of teachers and students, and improve the efficiency of communication. This type of website is a question-and-answer SNS website between an encyclopaedia and traditional Q & A. It is a public knowledge platform, and its value lies in rebuilding the relationship between people and information. Users ask questions and other users answer. The Q & A service expands broad keywords into clear questions and realizes the conversion of information to knowledge through constant revision by users.

## 1.3 Project Phase Analysis

### 1.3.1 Stage 1- Background research and Requirement Analyse 

1. By understanding the current situation and shortcomings of traditional Q & A websites, a preliminary analysis of the functional requirements of the system is made.
2. Make a questionnaire and distribute it on campus to learn about the habits of users and the status of self-study. There are 50 copies. Data were collected through questionnaires.
3. Randomly select a user for a face-to-face interview. Specify 4-5 main questions about self-study for interviews and invite users to answer. Record the results of the interview for later analysis.
4. Perform a step-by-step analysis of the collected data. First, analyse the data obtained from the questionnaire to determine user needs, and then analyse the interviews to obtain data. Finally, combined with the conclusions of the questionnaire survey and interviews, determine the exact user needs.

### 1.3.2 Stage 2- Program Development

1. First analyse user needs in combination with actual conditions, and discuss what technology is used to implement each requirement after the analysis is complete.
2. After completing most of the requirements, the code will be integrated and sent to the user, and the user will suggest modifications through the experience system.
3. Changes in requirements at any time during development

### 1.3.3 Stage 3- Test 

1. Unit tests are performed after not completing a module
2. Integration tests will be performed after the modules are brought together
3. Complete usability testing before submitting the system to users
4. After the system is submitted to the user, the user's internal test is first performed.
5. Perform all usability tests, stress tests, etc. in a real network environment

### 1.3.4 Stage 4- Deployed

After all development work and testing work are completed, the project will be deployed in a real network environment.

## 1.4 Background research

### 1.4.1 Second-hand Research

Second-hand research can help me identify the most promising markets by excluding unsatisfactory markets and lay the groundwork for further field investigations.

- **Second-hand research can help me identify the most promising markets by excluding unsatisfactory markets and lay the groundwork for further field investigations.**

  In international marketing, the role of second-hand data research is mainly manifested in the following two aspects:

  Second-hand research is an important source of information, for the next step in the development of research direction to lay the foundation. 

  Second-hand research can provide the necessary background information for field research, so that the goal of field research clearer, so as to save time and research costs, for field research to lay the foundation.

- **Summary of second-hand research**  

  Investigate the status of existing Q & A communities and user feedback via the Internet.

  After investigation found, the comprehensive Q & A community for universities is very scarce, and some companies have directly stopped the Q & A service (eg Google). Other types of Q & A communities only include some basic functions, and the functions that can be achieved are relatively single, and most of them only implement the functions of asking and answering questions. On the other hand, in terms of user search results, there are also limitations to what can be searched. Of course, the most important point is that this type of system is for global users, and the user range and user quality cannot be effectively controlled. In addition, the users of some systems are more targeted users and cannot be used by anyone (such as stackoverflow).
